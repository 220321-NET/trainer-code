### Aim of the Training
As we embark in this 10 week journey together, it is important to keep in mind the aim of this training. This training is designed to prepare you to work as a professional software developer in an enterprise level software. As such, our expectation is different from other educational settings you may have experienced in the prior. One difference is that we conduct this training in work setting.  Trainers not only act as the teacher of their cohorts, but we also perform many managerial duties and should be considered a manager. Moreover, we emphasize developing soft skills as much as technical skills, so expect to see different activities designed to help you develop your soft skills.

### Attendance
During training, you are expected to be available and be present in our zoom meeting from 10AM - 6PM EST Monday through Friday. Lunch is from 1PM to 2PM EST.

Attendance to these meetings are not optional and too many unexcused absences will be escalated to HR. For any circumstances that you have to miss the training for, such as medical appointment or illness, please let me know as soon as possible.

### Communication
It is pertinent to keep an open line of communication during and after the training. We the revature staff are here to help you be successful and we cannot help if you don't communicate difficulties you're facing. 

Email will be our official method of communication. Please check your revature.net email frequently. We will also utilize other unofficial ways such as discord but sensitive information should not be shared on the discord server.

### Professionalism
Professionalism and respect go both ways. Let's respect each other so we can create and foster a safe and friendly working environment
- Please respect each other's time. Consistent tardiness will not be tolerated.
- No hate or discriminatory speech
- Use professional languages and address others professionally
- Follow the company policy, especially regarding dress code, behavior, etc.

#### Zoom Etiquette
Because we conduct our training virtually, there are additional etiquettes to be observed in zoom meetings
- Have your display name be your preferred first and last name
- Make sure your background is neat and professional. Either use a virtual background or make sure what we see behind you is not a mess.
- Camera must be on during QC and presentations
- Please mute yourself if not speaking
- Raise your virtual hand if you want to speak/ask questions
- Do not enter my breakout room without getting my permission as it can violate others' privacy. And that includes even if I appear to be alone in the room. 

## What to Expect During Training

### Weekly Evaluation
Every week there will be an assortment of evaluations to check your understanding of the topic discussed in the weeks prior. Take these evaluation as the opportunity to identify your weak spots in your conceptual and technical understanding.

These evaluation tend to occur on the beginning of the week, but do note that the schedule may change and please be flexible with us as we schedule them.

#### Quiz
There will be a weekly multiple choice quiz on the prior week's topic. Expect them to take around 60 minutes or less. These questions test topic understanding as well as code comprehension.

#### QC: Mock Interview
The QC team handles this particular evaluation which is aimed to help you practice answering technical interview questions in interview-like settings. The list of topics will be announced the week prior, but expect it to cover all topics that were covered between the last QC and the upcoming one. Refer to Revature Pro curriculum for all topics that may be on the table. You are expected to study the topics that is listed on Revature Pro's curriculum, regardless of whether we spent time during training covering those topics or not.
(Think of these like interviews rather than school tests, the interviewer does not necessarily care if your course covered a certain topic or not)

#### QC: Coding Evaluation
This particular evaluation tests your technical ability in coding interview settings. We'll be using iMocha and hackerrank to assess how well you translate word problems into working solutions. Expect to be given about 20 minutes per question, and you'll be allowed access to the official documentation during the evaluation.

### Projects
In training, we have 4 projects that are due on various weeks to practice the concepts and technologies we're learning. For each project, you'll present your project with a demo to showcase your project to your colleagues and me.

#### Project 0 (P0) - Due week 3
This is an individual project due on week 3 of the training. In this project, you will build a console application with C# and connect the application to SQL database hosted on the cloud for data storage. This project will be evaluated by QC and will replace Week 3 QC.

#### Project 1 (P1) - Due Week 4
This is an individual project due on week 5 of the training, this project will utilize Service Oriented Architecture and consists of RESTful API backend and console application frontend.

#### Project 2 (P2) - Due week 7
This is a small group project and we will build a RESTful API backend with Angular frontend.

#### Project 3 (P3) - Due Week 10
This last project is a cohort wide project. You'll build an enterprise level application in collaboration with CoE (Center of Excellence) which will provide you with the scope and requirements of the project. This project culminates in a showcase in which we invite all of Revature to showcase your work in the past 10 weeks and celebrate the end of training.

### Reporting
Occasionally you'll be asked to research on a topic and give a presentation on the topic to rest of the class. Take this as an opportunity to practice your research skills as well as yet another chance to become more comfortable speaking in front of people and hone your communication skills.

### Hackerrank Challenges
Coding isn't just about learning the technologies and knowing how to use them. Big part of coding is also knowing how to approach a problem and come up with working solutions. This tests a developer's problem solving skills as well as their creativity. We'll solve hackerrank questions to develop this skill as well as to prepare for any possible coding interviews.

### One on One's
There will be check in meetings with each of you. This will give us a chance to discuss how you are doing in the training and any support or resource I can give to help you get the most out of the training. Feel free to bring any questions/comments/concerns you have to these!

### Final Evaluations
As the training nears the end, we have a series of final evaluations to measure your client readiness. These evaluations cover all topics covered during the training. They are the following:

#### Panel
These are akin to the final exam. There are two portions, the video recording portion where you'll speak about your projects and multiple choice portion where you will take an exam regarding all topics covered during the training.

#### Cumulative QC
The last QC of the training will be a QC on all topics. This qc will also include behavioral questions such as 'Tell me about yourself'.

## Tips and Tricks
- We understand that we pull you in many different directions with all the activities we ask you to complete. Figure out a schedule that works for you and stick to it so you can devote sufficient time necessary to complete the work.
- Take one thing at a time, one day at a time, and one week at a time. Don't look ahead too much and get overwhelmed by the amount of work lying ahead of you. 
- Prioritize project work but don't skimp on preparing for QC. Many associates have said that QC's have helped in preparing for interviews.
- Break down big tasks to smaller tasks until it becomes workable. Many seemingly daunting tasks are just a collection of smaller, doable tasks.
- Stay engaged during demo/lecture and follow along if possible. If you have a question, ask! It's more than likely that others have a similar if not the same question as you do. You're doing everybody a service by stepping up and asking those questions.
- Work together as a group. Teamwork makes the dreamwork and team work is crucial in succeeding in this training. Pair program and debug together often. If you feel like you're bothering others by asking for help, remember that the person helping you out is getting as much if not more benefit out of it as you are. If you have more coding experience and see opportunities to help, do so! Teaching is one of the best ways to improve your understanding of the topic. You are not competing for jobs here and you'll eventually work together in P2 and P3, so more you can bring each other up, the better time you'll have together later on.
- Don't forget to breathe! When going gets tough just remember that thousands of others have gone through this training and have successfully launched their tech careers. Make time to get up, walk around, and take care of yourself
- Take self-care seriously, both your physical and mental health. Have fun, take some time away from the code to do other things that you enjoy and bring smiles on your face. Connect with your colleagues and people outside of the work to decompress and destress whenever possible. 10 weeks is not terribly long but also not short enough to pull straight all nighters through. Figure out a way to manage your stress so you can reap the most benefit out of this training.
- Remember we're here to help you succeed. Don't be afraid to reach out for additional help if you need any.

## Advice to New Associates (As given by graduated associates)
The Following is the advice that my past associates have given to you.
- Ask for advice. Give help where you can. Cooperate with your batchmates, they'll be good friends to have moving into staging.
They should make sure to research terms for themselves if something doesn't click right away so they can come to their own sense of understanding
- Work with people early on since you have to work with them at the end
- .Net is better then Java
- Closed mouths don't get fed. Swallow your pride and ask questions and for help when you need it. Study hard and most importantly enjoy what you are coding because no one wants to code something they're not invested in. Help teammates debug. Watch the recordings for step-by-step instructions.
- Start your studying grind early. Even when you think you understood the lecture well, make sure you review it before the next day, because it is super easy to get completely lost if you aren't confident in what you went over from the past few days.
- Don't try to learn everything in one day, and be mindful of not spreading yourself too thin. There will always be time later down the road to polish what you need to. Make friends, ask questions, and remember that everyone is learning and you are in a team now!
- Break down large problems into smaller ones. Tackle them one day at a time. As long as you spend time on them, you will come up with a solution. Don't feel time was wasted if you spent an entire day solving one typo or bug, because it pays off in the long run.
- Follow along with the lectures, even if it means rewatching them afterwards.
- Soft skills are 50% of the job. If you have good soft skills, you can bs your way through everything else like I did.
- Re-watching the lecture recordings are really helpful. Creating a timeframe for the recordings is helpful to refer back for certain topics afterwards. Don't hesitate to ask for help, be cooperative with your batchmates. Don't give up and good luck for them xD
- Project work matters more than anything else. Ask as many questions during the training as you can. Stackoverflow is literally the best companion any developer can have
- Communication is one of the most important aspects of training.
- Make sure to ask questions if you don't understand anything.
- Keep up with the recorded videos and watch them soon as possible to stay up to date with the content.
- If you know there are stronger associates in your batch, feel free to connect with them and ask for help.
- rewatch the training videos! the recordings are crucial
-reach out to your batch mates for help, study sessions, and paired programming
-Start early on projects, don't be afraid to ask questions, re-watch lectures for better understanding and look at the tabs on revature to make sure you are covering every aspect you need
- look at the curriculum on revpro and study anything that doesn't get covered
- do whatever it takes to stay up to date with all the information, if you fall behind its very hard to catch up with the fast pace of the program.
