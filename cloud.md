# Cloud

## What is cloud?
Tucker: A place where users can store data on a remote host
Lara: On demand delivery service, pay as you go, network
Donte: A DB that's not hardwired to the machine

In the simplest terms, cloud is like renting hardwares/servers, similar to owning vs renting a house/condo/apt/townhouse, etc.

When we own a house:
Pros: Set your own rules. once you pay it off, it's yours- you have complete control over it. More space in house. Usually cheaper.
Cons: A lot more upkeep on our end, like maintenance, taxes, might end up with too much or too little space (you can't really just get rid of the basement or a couple bedrooms)

When we rent:
Pros:
Pay just when you rent, flexibility, if somethings happens you can just call your landlord, they take of the maintenance and upkeep of the house

Cons: More expensive, you're bound by their rules, have to deal with landlord, it's not yours, have to wait for maintenance... etc.

## Advantages of using cloud
- **Flexibility to scale, pay as you go**
- Security

## Different types of scaling
- Horizontal Scaling (Scaling OUT): More servers
- Vertical Scaling (Scaling UP): Purchase more Powerful server. 

## Different Services
IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service, is literally just a hardware, ie VM
PaaS: Platform as a Service,  IaaS + some kind platform for a certain functionality, ie DB Server, App Services
SaaS: Software as a Service, ie Adobe, Microsoft 365, Gmail, Software is provided to client as a service (IaaS + Paas + the application)

## On Ground...
- Data Centers: is a self contained big building full of server racks, it has its own power supply and everything else to operate those servers.
- Availability Zones: is a collection of data centers 
- Location: Is a collection of 1 or more availability zone

## Other Cloud related terms:
- SLA: Service Level Agreement, basically states that your service that you purchase is guaranteed to be available for a certain amount of time each month. For example, there is 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%
