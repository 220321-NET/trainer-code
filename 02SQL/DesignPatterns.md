# Design Pattern

## Repository Design Pattern 
Is to abstract away the data access code from the users of the class and just presenting a nice interface for them to use.
This is another example of abstraction.
For example of this: FileRepo, DBRepo
vs DAO Pattern?

## Unit of Work Design Pattern
Is a design pattern that "collects" jobs and executes in a single unit
Examples that we've seen are ADO.NET disconnected architecture and dataAdapter.Update() method.
